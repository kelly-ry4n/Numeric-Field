DrawGui.py:
    Contains a WX gui initialization and methods.

    TODO: Add console/logging

FieldSolver.py

    TODO: 3d

    TODO: Change how charges are handled for lines and rectangles so that a line/rectangle has the charge specified (as opposed to each point having that charge)

    TODO: Improve accuracy?

Files.py

    TODO: fix small bug when saving/loading: Saves and adds a blank line after data which crashes loader. Can probably be fixed by either not written that blank line or not reading it.

mathparse.py
    Contains the parser for polish notation math expressions.

    TODO: Add additional functions.. sin, cos, etc.
            -Done

Parser.py
    Contains the parser for the DSL used for input

    TODO: Add time dependance

PlotOnFig.py
    Contains functions which given a figure will plot data. Currently gets functions to plot from caller.


    TODO: Impliment 3d plotting

    TODO: Add parameters to control contours, vectors, looks, etc.
            -Has this been done satisfactorally? or should we go for more user control?

    TODO: Wrap this in a few different ways for different types of plots

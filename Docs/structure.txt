DrawGui.py:
    Contains a WX gui initialization and methods.

    TODO: Fix threading

    TODO: Fix progress bar stretch

    TODO: Add console/logging


GravityField.py
    Currently plots gravitational fields to a pyplot plot.

    TODO: Separate into multiple modules for math, different types of fields,
    and move plotting functionality to PlotOnFig.py

    TODO: Move functionality to FieldSolve.py

PlotOnFig.py
    Contains functions which given a figure will plot data. Currently gets functions to plot from caller.

    TODO: Move computations to FieldSolve.py, leaving only plotting functionality.

    TODO: Break different types of plots into different functions. Reduce number of parameters
    by doing so.

    TODO: Impliment 3d plotting

    TODO: Add parameters to control contours, vectors, looks, etc.

    TODO: Wrap this in a few different ways for different types of plots


FieldSolve.py

    TODO: Impliment this! For more than one type of field?

    TODO: Improve accuracy?

FieldCreator.py:
    TODO: Impliment this!

    TODO: Create functionality to quickly create various types of field initializations. For example:
    - Rectangles of change, given density, position, size
    - Circles of charge, given position, size
    - 2d curves of chage, given functions
    - 3d calculations? INSANITY

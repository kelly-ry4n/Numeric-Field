    Contains functions which given a figure will plot data. Currently gets functions to plot from caller.


    TODO: Impliment 3d plotting

    TODO: Add parameters to control contours, vectors, looks, etc.

    TODO: Wrap this in a few different ways for different types of plots


FieldSolver.py

    TODO: 3d

    TODO: More than one magnitude of charge? Right now it just makes all charges be the same mag

    TODO: Improve accuracy?

FieldCreator.py:
    TODO: Impliment this!

    TODO: Create functionality to quickly create various types of field initializations. For example:
    - Rectangles of change, given density, position, size
    - Circles of charge, given position, size
    - 2d curves of chage, given functions
    - 3d calculations? INSANITY

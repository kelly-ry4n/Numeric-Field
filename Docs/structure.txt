DrawGui.py:
    Contains a WX gui initialization and methods.

    TODO: Add console/logging



PlotOnFig.py
    Contains functions which given a figure will plot data. Currently gets functions to plot from caller.


    TODO: Impliment 3d plotting

    TODO: Add parameters to control contours, vectors, looks, etc.

    TODO: Wrap this in a few different ways for different types of plots


FieldSolver.py

    TODO: 3d

    TODO: Impliment this! For more than one type of field?
                    This has been "implemented", field solver now takes in what kind of field it is and the charge of the blob,
                    however it doesn't seem to be plotting the changes. Might have to do with the function call in DrawGui.py (line 151-152)
                    not being updated, but it crashes as soon as I change anything :(

    TODO: Improve accuracy?

FieldCreator.py:
    TODO: Impliment this!

    TODO: Create functionality to quickly create various types of field initializations. For example:
    - Rectangles of change, given density, position, size
    - Circles of charge, given position, size
    - 2d curves of chage, given functions
    - 3d calculations? INSANITY
